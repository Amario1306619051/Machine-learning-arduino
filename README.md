# MicroML on Arduino

MicroML is a tool that brings machine learning algorithms to microcontrollers, allowing you to deploy machine learning models on devices with limited computational resources.

This repository demonstrates how to use MicroML to deploy machine learning models on Arduino boards. It provides examples of loading datasets, training classifiers, and generating C/C++ code to port the trained model onto your Arduino.

## Supported Classifiers

MicroML supports a range of classifiers that can be used for various tasks. Some of the supported classifiers include:

- DecisionTree
- RandomForest
- XGBoost
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVC and OneClassSVM)
- Relevant Vector Machines
- SEFR (Fast Linear-Time Classifier)
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

## Installation

To use MicroML, you need to install the `micromlgen` library. You can do this using pip:

```sh
pip install micromlgen
```

## Getting Started

1. Prepare your dataset by creating CSV files for each class. Place these files in a folder named "dataset".

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.

3. Upload your dataset CSV files to the "dataset" folder in the Jupyter Notebook.

4. Run the notebook cells to load the features, train the machine learning classifier, and generate C/C++ code for your Arduino.

5. Copy the generated C/C++ code to your Arduino sketch to deploy the trained model.

## Example Usage

In the provided Jupyter Notebook, you'll find examples of loading features from CSV files, training a DecisionTree classifier, and generating the corresponding C/C++ code to port the classifier onto an Arduino board.
